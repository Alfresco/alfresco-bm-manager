Sample load tests, Alfresco-specific load tests and utility libraries will be available here, too.

At present (Dec 2013) development of the Benchmark Server framework is ongoing at

All code will be ported to this repository prior to release of V2.0.0.

Rest API and UI are coming along well.  We anticipate a pause in development during the second half of December.
A full end-to-end load test is not yet ready for demo.
