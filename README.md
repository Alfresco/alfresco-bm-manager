alfresco-benchmark
==================

Sample load tests, Alfresco-specific load tests and utility libraries will be available here, too.

At present (Dec 2013) development of the Benchmark Server framework is ongoing at
   https://svn.alfresco.com/repos/alfresco-enterprise/benchmark/server/HEAD

All code will be ported to this repository prior to release of V2.0.0.

2013-12-02:
==========

Rest API and UI are coming along well.  We anticipate a pause in development during the second half of December.
A full end-to-end load test is not yet ready for demo.

2014-04-10:
==========

Another 2 weeks available for development.  Unit tests and tests with in-place Mongo are successful.  Packaging refactor is finished.  Control APIs and status updates all working.  Sample test is integrated but has a few refactor-related bugs that need ironing out.
Code transfer to GitHub will probably take place next sprint (from 21 April 2014).
